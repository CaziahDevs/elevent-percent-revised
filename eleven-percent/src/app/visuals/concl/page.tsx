                        ranged for at least twenty years. At this point, the black students represented 6.02% of all students, growing only 4% since 1960: a full forty years later.

                        these gains, the average percentages of black students were comparable at 5.78% (2000s) and 5.81%(2010s), representing only a 3% increase from one decade to the next.
